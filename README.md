Facial Recognition using OpenCV and HOG Algorithm

This project implements facial recognition using OpenCV and the Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) algorithm. The goal is to detect and recognize faces in images or video streams.

Features

- **Face Detection**: Utilizes the HOG algorithm for efficient face detection.
- **OpenCV Integration**: Leverages the powerful OpenCV library for image processing and computer vision.
- **User-friendly Interface**: Provides a simple and intuitive interface for face recognition tasks.

Prerequisites

- Python
- OpenCV library

Setup

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Facial-recognition-using-OpenCV-and-HOG-algorithm.git
